    <h1>Pork Dumplings</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients needed for the recipe</h3>

    <ul>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers

        1 Â¾ pounds ground pork
        
        1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
        
        4 cloves garlic, minced
        
        2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion
        
        4 tablespoons soy sauce
        
        3 tablespoons sesame oil
        
        1 egg, beaten
        
        5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.</li>
            
            <li>
                Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</li>
            
            <li>
                Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.</li>
            
        </ol>
